2. Execute run_plumemom_hysplit.sh - Does the PlumeMoM & Hysplit simulation

3. Execute create_plots.sh         - Plots the output in terms of particles/gas concentration and position inside the computational domain

4. Execute extract_samples.sh      - Extracts particles mass loading at specific lat-lon locations (see input_file.py)

5. Execute check_part.sh           - Computes the mass of solid particles in the domain 

6. Execute check_gas.sh            - Computes the mass of volcanic gas in the domain

7. Execute clean_all.py            - Clean the working directory
